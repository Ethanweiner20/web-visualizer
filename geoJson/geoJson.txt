This folder contains JSON data that defines where to place nodes (routers)
on the map. This data is generated directly in Javascript.
The fixed locations of oceanic cables are imported from an external database for usage.
Importing all router locations is, for obvious reasons, highly impractical, so
instead, the locations are semi-randomly generated, based on where Internet access is the highest.
Instead of displaying every router, the map only displays a representative
number of routers.
