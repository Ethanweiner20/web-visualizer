JS will be used to controll all aspects of the animation.

Static JS files receive as input:
- Request information: 
- Destination IP address & location (lat/lng)

Static JS files produce as output:
- Routers
- A "request" animation that displays:
--- Current location
--- An assortment of routes
--- Packets being sent down a few routes (using fiber optic cables)
--- Destination location
- A "response" animation that displays roughly the same thing in reverse

The actual storage of the routers/landing points, & the routing function itself,
will be a backend process, whereas the animation of this process will be frontend.
