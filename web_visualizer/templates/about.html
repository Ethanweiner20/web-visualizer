          <p>Web Visualizer is an app that roughly simulates the geographic transmission of data across the Internet.
              Specifically, it visualizes possible routes that packets might take during a web request. <span class="red-text">Packets</span> are small units of data
              into which a request is broken into. These packets are sent along a cable-path connecting some series of routers and landing points. A <span class="red-text">landing point</span> is a 
              special type of router on the coast that is used to send data overseas, to other landing points! The routers and landing points displayed
              on the map actually indicate the location of real routers with real IP addresses, directly imported from a global database of routers and landing points. Web Visualizer lets you create your own request to some domain. Feel free to experiment with
              request options such as the "number of routers" and "number of packets" to animate, and make sure to read the legend to understand the symbols on the map.

            Web Visualizer intends to show:
            <ul>
                <li>that the Internet is really comprised of a system of <span class="red-text">routers</span> connected by <span class="red-text">cables</span>, not some arbitrary "cloud"</li>
                <li>the <span class="red-text">request-response model</span> that all web requests follow</li>
                <li>that a singular web request is not sent as a singular chunk, but rather as a series of <span class="red-text">packets</span>.</li>
                <li>that packets might take vastly different routes to travel to the same destination</li>
                <li>that data might need to travel in fiber optic cables <span class="red-text">overseas</span> to reach its destination</li>
                <li>how amazing it is that this whole process occurs at <span class="red-text">lightning speed</span>!</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
              It is important to note that Web Visualizer is not a precise or accurate simulation of the web; it is only a representation.
              Some important clarifications to note are:
              <ul>
                  <li>Web Visualizer only displays a small number of routers. In reality, there are billions of routers worldwide.</li>
                  <li>For animation purposes, Web Visualizer only displays a few packets per request. In reality, depending on the size of the request and response, there will be many more packets transmitted.</li>
                  <li>The algorithm that Web Visualizer uses to route packets differs immensely from, and is much more simplistic than, the IP-based algorithm
                      that real-world routers to route packets. The routes that packets would actually take would be quite different.
                  </li>
              </ul>
